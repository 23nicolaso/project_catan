## RUST CATAN
What if Settlers of Catan was a singleplayer game, coded in Rust, for the command line? 
(This is my first project in Rust, and I'm just trying to learn the language)

*HOW TO PLAY:*
NOTE: NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED YET
1. Run main.rs
2. Run commands with / followed by the command, i.e. /map
3. Build properties, roll the dice, trade
4. If you roll the dice, all properties which have the corresponding number get resources
5. If you roll a 7, you get taxed 50% of all your resources
6. Try to get as rich as possible!
